# Weather Site Django



Introducing my user-friendly weather web application, built with the Django framework and utilizing the latest technologies such as OpenWeather and Geo Names APIs. My application offers real-time, accurate weather information for any city, providing users with up-to-date data on current conditions, forecasts, and more.

The homepage features a dynamic and comprehensive weather display, with the default location set to Arlington, TX. Users have access to real-time information, including current temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, visibility, and the current date and time for the selected location. In addition, our advanced forecast feature provides users with detailed information on the weather for the next several hours as well as a four-day forecast, allowing them to plan and prepare accordingly.
